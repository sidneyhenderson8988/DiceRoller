# DiceRoller
A dice rolling application for various sided dice. It is also capable of handling coin flips. Below is a sneak peek at the application.
I created this program using Java in Eclipse and by utilizing JFrame and Java Swing for the GUI. Feel free to see my code in the "SRC" folder!

As of now, the program is not too asthetically pleasing, but I intend to change that in the future.

To use, first download the "DiceRoller.exe" executable file.

Here is an image that shows how to use the application.

First, if you would like to roll multiple dice of the same type, enter an amount up to 10. This allows you to roll up to 10 dice at once.
If you enter a number greater than 10, or a character that is not a number, the amount of dice rolled will default to "1".

After entering the amount of dice you would like to roll, simply click the "Roll a..." button.
This will display your results in the long text box above the "Roll a..." button.
